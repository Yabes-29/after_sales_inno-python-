 	<strong>Sales Warranty(inno_after_sales)</strong> is an Odoo app from BroadTech which helps to maintain the warranty details and service information of products sold to customers and thus smoothen the after sales activities. 	
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 
	  Warranty records are created manually by the system manager. The warranty records maintain reference to the sale order and the invoice related to the product. 
	  Each Warranty record begins its lifecycle from the "In Warranty" stage. Warranty End date captured in the warranty form is the key element which determines the lifecycle of the warranty. The system checks the date on daily basis and changes the status of the record automatically as it approaches the expiry date

The "To Expire" stage of warranty records are critical for sales team. They have to campaign respective customers and try to extend the warranty of the products by making additional payment. The system helps to manage such campaign more efficiently by allowing the salesman to mark the outcome of the campaign. If the customer is not at all interested in extending the service, the salesman can use the button "End Campaign" which in turn flags the customer as "Not Interested". 
This will increase efficiency of sales team by filtering out the leads that won't work out.
